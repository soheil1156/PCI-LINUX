# PCI-LINUX
The "PCI-LINUX" project on GitHub is developed by Me and is related to the implementation of Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) device drivers in the Linux operating system. It appears that the project is aimed at providing a basic understanding of how PCI devices can be managed in a Linux environment.

The project includes several source code files that demonstrate the implementation of a simple PCI driver for a hypothetical device. The code includes functions for probing the device, allocating and freeing resources, reading and writing to the device, and handling interrupts from the device. The code is written in C and is intended to be compiled and run on a Linux system.

The project also includes a Makefile for compiling the code, as well as some shell scripts for testing the driver and displaying information about the device. There is also a brief README file that provides some background information on PCI devices and the project itself.

In conclusion, the "PCI-LINUX" project appears to be a resource for those who are interested in learning about how PCI devices can be controlled in a Linux environment. It provides a simple, hands-on example of how a PCI driver can be implemented in Linux and serves as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.
